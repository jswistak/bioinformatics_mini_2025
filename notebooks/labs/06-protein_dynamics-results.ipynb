    "- **Free Energy Landscape** - what stable conformations exist\n",

    "- Proteins visit many shapes, not just one (like a dancer performing many poses)\n",
    "- Stability is linked to energy minima (proteins \"prefer\" certain conformations)\n",
    "- Function often involves movement between states (enzymes need to open/close, receptors need to bind/unbind)\n",

    "**🤔 Key Questions**:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction vs Reality**: Did the regions with high B-factors (from crystallography) match the regions with high RMSF (from MD)? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RMSD Interpretation**: If RMSD increases over time, what does that mean? Is the protein becoming more or less stable?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Free Energy Landscape**: If you see multiple valleys in the free energy landscape, what does that tell you about the protein?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Biological Function**: How might flexibility be important for a protein's function? Can you think of examples where rigidity would be important instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simulation Limitations**: We simulated 0.2 nanoseconds. Real biological processes can take microseconds to seconds. What events might we miss?\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Bonus Challenge**: Try running the simulation with a different temperature (e.g., 350K = 77°C). How does the RMSD and flexibility change? What does this tell you about temperature effects on proteins?\n"
